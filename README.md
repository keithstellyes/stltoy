This is a repo to help me learn Rust. It will use wgpu

- First, I'm adding an STL file parser

- Second, will have it display

- Third, be able to apply various shaders and such

I'm still learning rust, feel free to give feedback to help me learn :-)

PR's may be accepted if it's to help make it more Rustic or if it'd help me otherwise learn.
In other words... if you're doing it for me, I'm just going to reject it!!!
